&lt;strong&gt;인터넷&lt;/strong&gt;(Internet)이란 International Network의 줄임말로 Web의 가장 핵심적인 기술이라고 할 수 있다. 
기본적으로, 인터넷이란 무수히 많은 컴퓨터들이 통신할 수 있도록 하는 &lt;strong&gt;거대한 네트워크 통신망&lt;/strong&gt;이다.
수많은 컴퓨터들이 통신하기 위해서 컴퓨터 &lt;strong&gt;TCP/IP&lt;/strong&gt;를 이용하는데 이 장에서는 인터넷이 기본적으로 어떻게 작동하는지만 다룬다.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;두 대의 컴퓨터로 이루어진 단순한 네트워크&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/built/images/internet_network_1_one2one.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;2대 컴퓨터&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; height=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
인터넷이라는 커다란 네트워크를 이해하기 전 아주 작은 네트워크에 대해서 먼저 이해를 하자. 
서로 다른 두 대의 컴퓨터가 통신을 하기위해서는 서로의 컴퓨터가 물리적(Ethernet) 혹은 무선(WiFi, Bluetooth)으로 &lt;strong&gt;연결&lt;/strong&gt;되어 있어야 한다.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;N 대의 컴퓨터로 이루어진 단순한 네트워크&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/built/images/internet_network_2_multi2multi.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;N대 컴퓨터&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; height=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
두 대만의 컴퓨터로는 하나의 유선 케이블(무선도 동일)이 필요하다. 
네트워크는 이렇게 간단하지 않으므로 N 대의 컴퓨터를 고려하자.
각각의 컴퓨터를 모두 연결하려면 필요한 유선 케이블 수는 &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;개이다. 
단순하게 컴퓨터를 연결하는 방법으로는 인터넷이라는 거대한 네트워크를 구축하기에는 제약이 있다.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;라우터을 이용한 단순한 네트워크&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/built/images/internet_network_3_router.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;라우터 연결&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; height=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
직접적으로 연결하는 문제를 해결하기 위해 &lt;strong&gt;라우터&lt;/strong&gt;(Router)라는 소형 컴퓨터를 사용한다.
여러대의 컴퓨터는 직접적으로 연결하는 것이 라우터에 연결된다.
라우터는 중간 전달자 역할을 하는데, 각 컴퓨터가 보내려고 하는 데이터를 받아 보내려는 컴퓨터로 정확하게 전달한다.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;사전적 의미의 라우터(Router)란 네트워크와 네트워크 간의 경로를 설정하고 빠른 길로 트래픽을 이끌어주는 장비.
대표적인 기능은 네트워크 간의 연결이지만, NAT(Network Address Translation), 방화벽, VPN 등 부가 기능도 함께 제공한다.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/built/images/internet_network_4_router_expand.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;라우터 확장&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; height=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
컴퓨터를 확장하였듯 라우터도 확장이 가능하다.
라우터를 확장하게 되면 앞서 언급한 네트워크들보다 훨씬 큰 네트워크를 구축할 수 있다.
하지만, 라우터도 역시 한계는 존재한다. 
우리의 목적을 위해 네트워크를 구축하였듯 다른 사람들도 다른 지역에서 라우터를 이용하여 새로운 네트워크를 구축할 수 있다.
하지만 유선 케이블(무선 통신도 동일)을 먼 곳까지 모두 연결하는 것은 불가능하다.
&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/built/images/internet_network_5_modem.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;모뎀 연결&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; height=&quot;60%&quot; /&gt;
이를 가능하도록 하는 무엇인가가 필요한데, 이미 구축하여 세계 여러 지역에서 사용하고 있는 전화라는 좋은 시스템을 이용할 수 있다.
따라서, 이미 구축되어 있는 전화 시스템과 라우터를 이용하여 구축한 네트워크를 연결할 수 있는 &lt;strong&gt;모뎀&lt;/strong&gt;이라는 장비를 이용한다.
모뎀을 통해서 인터넷 서비스 제공 업체(Internet Service Provider, &lt;strong&gt;ISP&lt;/strong&gt;)에 접근할 수 있고, ISP가 구축한 네트워크를 통해 접근하려는 대상 네트워크로 접근이 가능하게 된다.
이러한 전체적인 네트워크 인프라로 인터넷은 구성된다.

&lt;p&gt;Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate-we can not consecrate-we can not hallow-this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us-that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion-that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain-that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom-and that government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>sanghyoson</name></author><category term="python" /><summary type="html">Python 강좌는 여러 절로 구성되어 있습니다.

We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate-we can not consecrate-we can not hallow-this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us-that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion-that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain-that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom-and that government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war.
